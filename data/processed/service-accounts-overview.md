# Service accounts overview

A service account is an OpenShift Container Platform account that allows a component to
directly access the API. Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project.
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API
access without sharing a regular user's credentials.

When you use the OpenShift Container Platform CLI or web console, your API token
authenticates you to the API. You can associate a component with a service account
so that they can access the API without using a regular user's credentials.

Each service account's user name is derived from its project and name:

```text
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
```

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

|system:serviceaccounts
|Includes all service accounts in the system.

|system:serviceaccounts:<project>

specified project.
